A simple low(ish) code development platform.

**This is very much a work in progress at this point!**

## Running

1. Clone the repo
2. Run setup.sh

4. Open a browser and point it at http://localhost:8002

## What does it do

Elemental currently allows you to:

* Construct simple document storage APIs using JSON schema
* Integrate with other simple APIs
* Construct your own more complex APIs
* Build simple rulesets for business logic/validation logic
* Construct server side first websites/interfaces and integrate them with the storage, integrations and rulesets services

## What does it not do

Alot of things, services that have not been fully completed:

* Administrative interface
* Documentation
* Identity provision & management
* Async messaging
* Process modelling
