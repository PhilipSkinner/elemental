# Documentation

Elemental is a low(ish) code development system that allows for integrations with existing systems and does not preclude the use of standard applications alongside it.

Each runtime within elemental supports open standards - that is standards that are defined outside of the system and that it just complies with.

The following links contain useful information about these standards:

* [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)
* [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
* [JSON Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2)

Further documentation relating to the runtimes held within Elemental can be found in the topics menu to the right. Important topics include:

* [Websites](#/documentation/websites.md)
* [Integrations](#/documentation/integrations.md)
* [Data](#/documentation/data.md)
